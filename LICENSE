# Privacy policy 

I am NOT collecting any of your data and I do NOT care how you use the application. 

It has been over 2 months and I still can't publish the app to Microsoft Store. And it is a totally FREE app for crying loud. 

I may not see it in Store before I die. 

# Disclaimer 

Store requires me to provide a privacy policy statement on https, which I don't really have at the moment. 

To publish a free app in Store is extremely difficult and confusing. The first attempt was started from mid April 2021, 
and it has been failing for various reasons, from my accounts to the package issues. The process is ridiculous and frustrating, 
worst experience as a developer.
