# Privacy policy 

I am NOT collecting any of your data and I do NOT care how you use the application. 

I do not know why Partner Center asking for this privacy statement, and I do not know how to skip this. 

Since this is a required field, I have to create a page here. You see, this app you are using is not using any Internet connection, and I don't even collect any telemetry. 

# Disclaimer 

Store requires me to provide a privacy policy statement on https, which I don't really have at the moment. 

To publish a free app in Store is extremely difficult and confusing, just some verdict.
